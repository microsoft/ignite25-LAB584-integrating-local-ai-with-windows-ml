## 🔥LAB584: Integrating Local AI with Windows ML

### Session Description

Build a smarter image classification app with Windows ML, now generally available. This hands-on lab walks through dynamically downloading execution providers (EPs) for NPUs, compiling models for hardware-specific EPs, and running inference locally. Learn to deploy, debug, and optimize your app using WinML APIs. Ideal for developers exploring AI acceleration on Windows devices—no pre-distributed EPs required.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Build an app which dynamically registers Execution Providers and uses shared ONNX Runtime
- Acquire and register execution providers using the Windows ML APIs.
- Compile, load, and run an ONNX model (SqueezeNet) with hardware acceleartion.

### 💻 Technologies Used

1. [WindowsML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview)
1. [ONNXRuntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/)
1. [WindowsAppSDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/)
